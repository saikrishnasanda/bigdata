## Communication plan
Zoom meetings, Atkins Library, Slack. 
We plan to communicate 3 times per week through zoom or in-person meetings based on the availability of the group members. The meetings will last for 2-3 hrs each. 
## Dataset
Canvas-sample-housing.csv: In this dataset, we will find data about the characteristics associated with a particular housing price. We can use this dataset to predict housing prices. With this dataset, use the Numeric prediction model type. The link to the dataset can be found here. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices 
## Business Problem or Opportunity, Domain Knowledge 
As the population increases day-by-day the demand for houses increases side by side. Predicting housing prices based on the characteristics of a locality is the task at hand. During the COVID-19 pandemic era, the demand for houses has increased rapidly. During this process, we should identify the most significant features in the California Housing Dataset. The real Estate domain is the most earning field in the world. Most realtors may not be able to provide a good house to the customers. We will be using machine learning techniques to predict California housing prices.
