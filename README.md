# Deliverable 1
## Team Members
* Kousik Varma Dandu
* Dinesh Reddy Chinnamallaiahgari
* Reddy Sai Krishna Sanda
* Sheshi Rekha Guntuka
## Communication plan
Zoom meetings, Atkins Library, Slack. 
We plan to communicate 3 times per week through zoom or in-person meetings based on the availability of the group members. The meetings will last for 2-3 hrs each. 
## Dataset
Canvas-sample-housing.csv: In this dataset, we will find data about the characteristics associated with a particular housing price. We can use this dataset to predict housing prices. With this dataset, use the Numeric prediction model type. The link to the dataset can be found here. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices
## Selection of Data
California Housing Prices

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices

Description:  ```California housing process```

Resource type: 
```S3 Bucket```

Amazon Resource Name (ARN): 
```arn:aws:s3:::housee```

AWS Region: 
```US East (N. Virginia) us-east-1```

## Business Problem or Opportunity, Domain Knowledge 
As the population increases day-by-day the demand for houses increases side by side. Predicting housing prices based on the characteristics of a locality is the task at hand. During the COVID-19 pandemic era, the demand for houses has increased rapidly. During this process, we should identify the most significant features in the California Housing Dataset. The real Estate domain is the most earning field in the world. Most realtors may not be able to provide a good house to the customers. We will be using machine learning techniques to predict California housing prices.
## Research Objectives and Questions
~ Find the location where the highest total rooms are located?  

~ What is the median house value in accordance with median housing age in different ocean proximities? 

~ How median house value can be compared with median house income?

~ What is the estimated value of the price in that specific location?

## Deliverable 2
5. Data Understanding
a) Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis was done through AWS Sagemaker. View the rendered file here: Exploratory Data Analysis(link need to attach)

b) Dashboard

Dashboard instances were created using AWS Quicksight and rendered as PDF files; however, due to billing limitations, the Dashboard instances are shutdown after analysis. The PDF extracts are available below. Additionally, these dashboards are analyzed in the Results section as a tool for evaluating the research objectives and questions.

6. Data Preparation
Data preparation was done at all levels of the project, including preliminary analysis of the dataset structures documented in the Open Dataset Registry. Data preparation activities include interpreting column data properly based on the tool being utilized, considering outlier data, invalid values, performing data manipulation, and more. Data preparation activities also included determining the most efficient tool to use in order to answer questions set forth by the research objectives and questions.
